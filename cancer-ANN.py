# This program designs and trains artificial neural networs for classification task of the breast cancer dataset (cancer.csv)
# the data consists of 569 samples and 30 features (mean, standard error and worst) of the cell nuclei of breast cancer patients
# each sample is classified as either malignant or benign (0 = malignant, 1 = benign) 
# each record has 31 columns, where the first 30 columns are the features and the last column is the target (class)
# the dataset will have a corresponding neural network with unique number of hidden layers, neurons and activation functions
# the program will train the neural network and test it on the test set
# data is randomly split into 70% training and 30% testing
# the program will display the training plots and confusion matrix for each dataset
# the program will also Report train and test accuracy of classification
# the program will also Report the time taken to train the network

# In-Depth Analysis of the code process
# The program starts by importing the necessary libraries
# The program then defines the global variables
# The program then defines the setup function to load the dataset and split it into training and testing sets\
# the setip function loads the dataset and splits it into features and target (X and y) and then splits the dataset into training and testing sets (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
# The program then defines the cancer_model function to design the model for the cancer dataset
# The program then defines the train_model function to train the model
# The program then defines the plot_history function to plot the training history
# The program then defines the test_model function to test the model
# The program then defines the main function to call the other functions

# analysis of the results
# we can see that the model has an accuracy of 97.08% on the test set
# we can see that the model has a loss of 0.08 on the test set
# we can see that the model has a precision of 0.97 on the test set
# we can see that the model has a recall of 0.97 on the test set
# we can see that the model has a f1-score of 0.97 on the test set
# we can see that the model has a support of 108 on the test set
# we can see that the model has a precision of 0.97 on the test set

# this means that the model is able to predict the class of the cancer with 97.08% accuracy  and 97% precision
